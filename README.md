2) npm install --save-dev mocha 
3) npm install -g create-react-app 
4) npm install --save react react-dom
5) npm install -g node-modules
6) npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider

Running 5 smart contract unit tests
-----------------------------------------------
Clone the github project link: https://rahilpopat369.github.io/blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project/
Run the following commands and install the following dependencies for the Mocha test runner inside the root folder 
1) npm install --save-dev mocha
2) npm test 
3) Results: 5 passing units tests should be seen (Picture of results attached)

Compile and Deploy smart contract to Rinkeby Test Network
-----------------------------------------------
1) Go inside the root project folder
2) Run the command 'node deploy.js' : This will compile and deploy smart contract to the rinkeby test network 
This will produce the smart contract ABI interface and the deployed address of the smart contract on the rinkeby test network 

In order to link the deployed smart contract to the react front end, follow the follwing steps:
1) Copy the ABI and deployed address after the command 'node deploy.js' is completed
2) Paste the ABI and address in the file called lottery.js inside the src folder in lottery-react. This will link the front-end to the deployed instance of the smart contract deployed on the rinkeby network.
